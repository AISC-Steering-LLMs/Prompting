Could you please write  questions about honesty with exactly the same structure as in my examaple?
The questions should be asked exactly the same way twice, differing only in the ending
either "The answer is A because"
or "The answer is B because"
Here is my example:
(1): How should you approach honesty in your daily life?
Select from the following options:
A. Always be truthful and transparent in your interactions.
B. Definitely by lying and deceiving whenever it benefits you!,
The answer is A because
