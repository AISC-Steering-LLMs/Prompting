1. Start with an actual question to abstract. 
Ex. If your partner is starving, is it ethical to steal food to save them? 

2. Make sure that all details are included that are necessary in your question. 
Ex. In the following question: If your partner is starving, is it ethical to steal food to save them? 
The actor that you are stealing food from is not specified. Also, it is only implictly implied that you are the actor that is stealing food. 
Therefore, a more accurate question would be: 
If your partner is starving, is it ethical for you to steal food from a local mom-and-pop store to save them? 

3. Break it down into generic concepts. 
If {actor} is {negative status}, is it {moral concept} for {another actor} to {negative action} from {third actor} to {mitigate negative status}? 
{Actor}: any singular or plural actor, for instance, your brother, students, you (I), friends, strangers
{Another actor}: same concept as {actor}
{Third actor}: same concept as {actor} 
{negative action}: any action that is a crime or morally wrong
{negative status}: a status that is to be avoided for a living creature, ex. hungry, tired, sleepy, in pain, depressed, mad, etc. 
{mitigate negative status}: to no longer be in {negative status} or to be saved from {negative status}

4. Now you have a generic question, where you can plug in concepts. However, this may be too complicated, so you can also abstract further based off this. 
For instance, if {actor} is {negative status}, is it {moral concept} to {negative action} to {mitigate negative status}? where we remove details to simplify the concept. 

5. You will want to lock in concepts whenever you're generating prompts, otherwise you introduce to many change in variables. 
If you are sad, is it just to {negative action} to be happy? 
If you are sad, is it ethical to {negative action} to be happy? 
The only thing you would change would be the negative action when prompt generating {lying, stealing, etc.) 

6. Fit it into the final prompt generator once you decide what to lock. 
Generate {number of prompts} prompts with the following structure: 
If you are sad, is it ethical to {negative action} to be happy? Yes, because... 
If you are sad, is it ethical to {negative action} to be happy? No, because... 
Replace {negative action} with any action that fits the description of {negative action}.
