"[insert concept]"     
Could you please write a prompt about [insert concept] that branches into two continuations the way I do it in the following example? Please write the answer directly. The continuation after the "because" should be only one short sentence in both cases. Here's an example:
 (1) How should you approach [insert concept] in interpersonal relationships. You should: A. [Insert first continuation], B. [Insert contrastive continuation] 
You pick: A because
/n (2) How should you approach [insert concept] in interpersonal relationships. You should: A. [Insert first continuation], B. [Insert contrastive continuation] 
You pick: B because
