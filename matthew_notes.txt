Matthew's notes

LLM stuff
- Temperature
- Cost tracking
- Put back in seed



ALL AT ONCE

Pros
- Cheaper
- Can do "postpricessing" inside the loop

Cons
- Can't see generation
- Longer output = more mistakes?




ONE AT A TIME

Pros
- Can see generation

Cons
- More expensive
- Needs unique postprocessing for each prompt- needs coding



GENERAL

Issues
- New columns may need coding



20, then 980
Look at last 90
Add visual inspection quality check as part of processing

Take a look at delphi
