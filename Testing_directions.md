__Testing directions__

1. Activation for concept C under prompting conditions P.

We want to test for the concept of [insert cocnept] when we have prompted the model to think in [insert moral theory] terms.

2. Activations that co-vary reliably between concepts

We want to test whether there is activation overlap between concepts C1 and C2 (e.g., truth, honesty)

3. Activations that indicate consistency in a model's preferences

3.1. Search for behavioral patterns (e.g., under what conditions does the model reply in the terms of [insert moral theory])  
3.2. Search for activation patterns in these behaviors  
3.3. Search for avoidance of behaviors
