Could you please write a question about {{ concept }} with exactly the same structure as in my examaple?
The question should be asked exactly the same way twice and differ only in the beginning of the response.
The beginning of the response is either
"The answer is A because"
or "The answer is B because"
Here is my example:
{{ example }}
End of example.
Do not write any other text in your output except for a correctly formatted example.
