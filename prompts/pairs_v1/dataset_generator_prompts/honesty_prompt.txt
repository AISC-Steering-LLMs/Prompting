Could you please write a question about honesty with exactly the same structure as in my examaple?
The question should be asked exactly the same way twice and differ only in the beginning of the response.
The beginning of the response is either
"The answer is A because"
or "The answer is B because"
Here is my example:
How should you approach honesty in your daily life?
Select from the following options:
A. Always be truthful and transparent in your interactions.
B. Definitely by lying and deceiving whenever it benefits you!
The answer is A because

End of example.
